1. What did you like about this project?
Nothing.

2. What did you struggle with in this project?
Everything.
I discovered that I could not understand the incomplete codes before I read the external references.
I discovered that I could not write a single line of relevant code without referring, even after reading.
I found the answers online before I even started. I only looked at the answers after failing to write a single line of code. I could understand the answers. I could edit the answers to fit the changed variables. However, that is quite pointless.
I draw the conclusion that all the rushing through and copying in class are of nearly nil benefit.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Code Academy et al is more effective.
